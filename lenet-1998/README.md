# LeNet-5 on MNIST (PyTorch)

This project is a clean and educational implementation of the classic **LeNet-5** convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset.

## 📌 Overview
LeNet-5 is one of the earliest convolutional neural networks, designed by Yann LeCun in 1998. It is used here to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.

## 🛠️ Features
- Simple, modular PyTorch codebase
- Reproducible training
- Accuracy: ~99% on MNIST test set

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py
```

## 📁 Files
- `model.py` — LeNet-5 architecture
- `train.py` — training loop
- `main.py` — entry point

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How CNNs process image data
- How to build and train a model from scratch
- Importance of reproducibility and modular code
